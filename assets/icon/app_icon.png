# This is a placeholder for the app icon PNG file
# In production, you would need to:
# 1. Create a proper 1024x1024 PNG icon file
# 2. Place it in assets/icon/app_icon.png
# 3. Run flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons to generate platform-specific icons
# 
# For now, we'll use the default Flutter icon that's already present in the project
